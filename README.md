# Heart-Disease-Trends-and-Pattern-Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to understand patient health characteristics, identify patterns, and analyze key factors associated with heart disease. The analysis helps in gaining insights that can support data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Dataset Source

* Kaggle: Heart Disease Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

## Tools Used

* Python – Core programming language
* Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
* NumPy – Numerical computations
* Matplotlib – Data visualization
* Seaborn – Statistical and correlation plots
* Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and presentation

## Key Insights

* Identified age groups with higher likelihood of heart disease.
* Observed relationships between heart disease and factors such as chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina.
* Analyzed distributions of clinical attributes like cholesterol and blood pressure.
* Used correlation analysis to understand how different health indicators relate to heart disease presence.
