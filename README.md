# Heart-Disease-Trends-and-Pattern-Analysis
This project looks at a heart disease dataset — a table of information about many patients that includes things like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and whether a patient has heart disease or not. The goal is to understand and explore the data to find patterns and useful information.
